# Sponsoring the project

All development on this firmware is done for the greater good of mankind. You can use it for free.
However, if you do feel the uncontrollable urge to contribute financially to the project, you can do
so through [this PayPal link](https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/bedsidelamp2).

This account is used for acquiring hardware and software licenses that I use for my open source
development. Specific hardware that I bought for this project were:

* An extra lamp for development and testing, so I don't annoy my wife with buggy deployements ;-)
* A dedicated serial to USB adapter, connected to the development lamp.
* a simple 8 port logic analyzer that helped me with reverse engineering the I2C protocol of the
  front panel.
* Various wires and buttons.
* An Arduino Uno R3, to [help out somebody in the community forums with
  flashing the lamp using the Arduino](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/hacking-yeelight-fw-enabling-lan-control/284406/214?u=mmakaay).
